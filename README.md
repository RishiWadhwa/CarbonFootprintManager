# CarbonFootprintManager
A project on how to manage your carbon footprint based on localized information and data.

This project will help people learn about their carbon footprint, calculate it, and minimize it very efficiently.

v1.0 Basic Emissions
- All emissions come with approximate number of trees cut or saved to give a meaning to the value given.
